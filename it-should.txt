[] It should have a gameboard
[] It should store the gameboard as an array inside a Gameboard object
[] It should have a factory function for creating player objects


If the previous and the next item has the same class and the next item is not 3 or 6 and the previous item is not 2, 4, 7 

If every third item had 2 following items with the same class

If 0, 4, and 8 has the same class or 2, 4, 6 has the same class 

if start at 3 and every 2nd item has the same class
If start at 0 and every fourth item has the same class
If every 3rd item in the array has the same class

//Check winner, should check for three in a row and a tie

//if 0, 1, 2 === equal - win
//if 3, 4, 5 === equal - win
//if 6, 7, 8 === equal - win

//if 0, 3, 6 === equal - win
//if 1, 4, 7 === equal - win
//if 2, 5, 8 === equal - win

//if 0, 4, 8 === equal - win
//if 2, 4, 6 === equal - win

//if none of the above & 8 cells marked === tie


//would it be eaier to make one array for each row and one for each column, and then two for diagonals?
//Or should I hardcode a check for each 
//use splice,filter to make new arrays of the main array to check for tie or win?


//if three in column or row 1 

array.splice(0, 3)
for (let i = 0; i < array.length; i += nth) {
   if (array[i].classList.contains('X') {
    winnerArr.push(array[i]);
   }
}
